This is file for testig vi functionality.. 
Like how in restaurants , when you order a dish,some waiters say "Excellent Choice,Sir" with a real emphasis on excellent as if they were thinking of eating that specific 
dish at that very moment and you are such a great dude for asking for it. You know they would have said the same thing if you had orderede *anything* else in the menu, but this
does not make you from feeling any less pleased about making that order. Which is the point of it I suppose.
It is surprising how such harmless manipulations work even when we know about them. Not bad an manipulations go, because everyone is happy in the end and no is harmed.d



It is an easy way to type really and you wil find it really useful when you are let loose in remote ssh shell with only vi
because vi is thhe default and the only dependable editor that will be the least common denominator in almost all systems you 
willl use.
